    <li>4 cups water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons concentrated liquid shrimp and crab boil (such as Zatarain's®)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
    <li>2 pounds live crawfish, rinsed</li>

  <h5>Potatoes, Corn, and Sausage</h5>

    <li>3 ears corn, shucked and cut into thirds, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package andouille sausage, sliced</li>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine water, dry crab boil, and seafood seasoning in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add live crawfish. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 0 (zero) minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build (as the pressure builds it will steam the crawfish.)</li>
    <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour crawfish and the liquid into a large bowl and let sit for 30 minutes to soak while you prepare the rest of the meal.</li>
    <li>Add potatoes, corn, andouille sausage, and 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning to the pot. Pour in water and stir until evenly combined. Close and lock the lid.</li>
    <li>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
    <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Divide the mixture between 4 plates and serve with crawfish.</li>
